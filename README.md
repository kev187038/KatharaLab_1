# How to run the applications
With python3.9:
```bash
python3.9 ./pox.py <application_1> ... <application_n>
```
Usual:
```bash
./pox/pox.py discovery_channel user_mobility fake_gateway host_tracking
```
Remember pox will be in ./pox. 
After loading the controller wait a bit for the links to be discovered! After they are discovered (the controller will send some messages like "added link si-sj, ports ..."), you can start pinging the internet module from the host using the interfaces with
```bash
 ping -I eth0/1/2/3 100.0.0.1
```
and you should see the user_mobility and host_tracking modules in action, while fake_gateway will provide the necessary layer 2 support underneath. 
IMPORTANT: whenever there is a change in flow search for "Event raised by" messages in the controller terminal, from there until the end of the log you can read how the whole event is handled. The host tracker
will tell where the host is using "Host is connected to..." messages.
